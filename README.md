# CurveRefiner
CurveRefiner is an innovative project designed to visualize 2D curves represented as polylines. It focuses on enhancing the curves by considering key properties such as regularization, symmetry, and completeness.

# Objective
The project is designed to work with curves represented by cubic BÃ©zier curves and polylines, with outputs visualized in CSV format.


# Features
## Regularize Curves
- Straight Lines: Detect straight lines within the curve data.
- Circles and Ellipses: Identify circular shapes where all points are equidistant from a center or ellipses with two focal points.
- Rectangles and Rounded Rectangles: Distinguish between sharp-edged and rounded rectangles.
- Regular Polygons: Detect polygons with equal sides and angles.
- Star Shapes: Identify star-shaped curves with a central point and radial arms.

## Exploring Symmetry in Curves
-  Detect and analyze the symmetry present in curves, including both reflectional and rotational symmetry.

## Completing Incomplete Curves
- Fully Contained Shapes: One shape completely inside another.
- Partially Contained Shapes: Shapes that are connected but partially occluded.
- Disconnected Shapes: Curves that are fragmented due to occlusion.

# Outcome
